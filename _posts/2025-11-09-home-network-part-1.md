## The Plan
To make a segmented home network for security and to learn about VLANs!

## Device Inventory
First we need to decide the number of VLANs needed and how they will connect to the router, that involves dividing the devices on the network into categories:
- Main devices, PCs
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart TVs etc.
- Servers
- Guest devices

## Network Hardware
- VLAN capable Router
- Managed switches
- Access points

## Network Topology
